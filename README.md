# Client Side QoL Fabric

This mod adds a couple of features to the game that make it easier to play. All of these features are client side so the mod does not have to be installed on the server.

## Features
#### Segmented Hotbar
Accessing slots after 5 with a keyboard might be cumbersome because the keys are just too far away. This feature makes the first keystroke select a section, and the second keystroke will select an item inside that section.

This feature is disabled by default, but can be enabled in the config of the mod, it's also divided into 2 entries, the function and the visual.

#### Firework Rocket Boost
A feature which makes it so when you press the jump key while flying it uses a firework rocket which is inside your inventory.

This feature is disabled by default, but can be enabled in the config of the mod.

#### Trident Loyalty Check
This option prevents you from throwing a Trident without Loyalty.

This feature is enabled by default, and can be disabled in the config of the mod.
